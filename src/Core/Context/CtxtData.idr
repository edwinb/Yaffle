module Core.Context.CtxtData

-- This module includes context data structures only (we need to reference
-- them in Error messages in Core.Error, and many context operations can
-- also throw errors)

-- Context entries read from TTC files will be stored as Binary, so when
-- we look them up, we have to decode them

         -- being inlined is terminating no matter what, and is really a bit
         -- of a hack to make sure interface dictionaries are properly inlined
         -- (otherwise they look potentially non terminating) so use with
         -- care!

    | PartialEval (List (Name, Nat)) -- Partially evaluate on completing defintion.
         -- This means the definition is standing for a specialisation so we

         -- at least once)
    | AllGuarded -- safe to treat as a constructor for the purposes of
         -- productivity checking. All clauses are guarded by constructors,
         -- and there are no other function applications

         -- thing, that can be compiled specially?
    | Identity Nat
         -- Is it the identity function at runtime?
         -- The nat represents which argument the function evaluates to
